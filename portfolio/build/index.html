                <p>I built my first pc in 2019, it was a challenge that I really enjoyed, even more when it worked
                    first try/attempt.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>A year later I decided to build a second PC quickly followed by a third. Not only that I built my own
                    PC but also repaired some of my friend's PCs and laptops. I was unable to build a PC in
                    Gateshead college for my BTEC level 2 due to Covid-19 however I wrote a document
                    outlining the procedures and used some of the photos of my own PC builds as evidence.
